# 05. Principle of Structural Limit

This document explores the minimum number of events required for a "structure" to emerge and defines the fundamental cost of that structure.

## From Event to Structure

A single event (N=1) or two events (N=2) are insufficient to define a structure. A minimum of three events (N=3) is required to define a relationship, a pattern, a "structure."

## The Uncertainty Principle and the Emergence of Structure

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2) provides a clue. The energy of an event and the time of an event are fundamentally linked. A structure, a relationship between events, can only emerge when there are enough events to define a meaningful "Δt".

## The Cost of the Minimal Structure

The cost of the minimal structure is the total action of the minimum number of events required for that structure to emerge.

-   **Minimum Events for Structure:** N = 3
-   **Fundamental Cost of Minimal Structure:** 3h

This is the fundamental quantum of structural cost in the MAE framework.
