# 03. Fundamental Costs of Structure and Action

This directory documents a critical phase in the development of the **MODELO DE ACCION ESTRUCTURAL (MAE)** theory, focusing on the fundamental energetic and action costs associated with structure and its creation.

This section explores:

-   **Energy of Purity:** The thermodynamic cost of reducing a "second" to an informational vacuum, based on the Landauer Principle.
-   **Energy of Ignition:** The quantum cost of initiating the first action in a system, based on Planck's Law.
-   **Energy of Reduction:** The cost of "erasing" time and the fundamental asymmetry between creation and destruction.
-   **Cost in Fundamental Units:** The abstraction of these costs away from conventional physical units to a pure action count (NÂ·h).
-   **Principle of Structural Limit:** The derivation of the minimum number of events (N=3) required for a structure to emerge and its fundamental action cost (3h).

This body of work establishes the most fundamental energetic and structural principles of the MAE framework developed to date.
