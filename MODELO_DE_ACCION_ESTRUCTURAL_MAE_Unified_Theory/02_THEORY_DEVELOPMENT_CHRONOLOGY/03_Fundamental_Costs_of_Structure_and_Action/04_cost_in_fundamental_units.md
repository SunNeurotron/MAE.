# 04. Cost in Fundamental Units

This document details the abstraction of the cost of a second away from conventional physical units (Joules) to a more fundamental unit of action.

## From Joules to Action

The energy costs calculated previously are dependent on the temperature of the system. A more fundamental measure of the cost of a second is its total action, which is independent of temperature.

The "Cost of Manifestation of the Second" is the total action of all the events within it.

## Calculation

The cost is simply the number of events (N) multiplied by Planck's constant (h).

```
Cost = N * h
```

For a second defined by the Cesium-133 transition:

```
Cost = 9,192,631,770 * h
```

This represents a pure quantity of action, the fundamental currency of the MAE framework.
