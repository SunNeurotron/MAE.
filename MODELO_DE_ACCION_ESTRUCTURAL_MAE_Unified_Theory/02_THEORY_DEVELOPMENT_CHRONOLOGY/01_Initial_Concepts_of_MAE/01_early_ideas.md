# 01. Early Ideas and Foundational Thoughts for MAE

This document is intended to capture the very first conceptualizations, intuitions, and driving questions that initiated the development of the MODELO DE ACCION ESTRUCTURAL (MAE). It precedes formal axiomatic definitions or rigorous mathematical frameworks, focusing instead on the initial spark of the theory.

**Key areas to document here include:**
- Initial observations or unresolved problems in existing physics that inspired MAE.
- Early intuitions about the nature of time, action, or reality.
- Preliminary philosophical considerations.
- Rough conceptual sketches or thought experiments.
- Early definitions or postulates (even if later refined).

(Content related to the genesis of MAE will be added here.)
