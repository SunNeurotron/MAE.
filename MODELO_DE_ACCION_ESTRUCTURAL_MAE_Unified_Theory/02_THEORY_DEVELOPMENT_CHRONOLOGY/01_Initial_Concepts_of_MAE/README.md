# Initial Concepts of MAE

This directory serves as the starting point for documenting the chronological development of the **MODELO DE ACCION ESTRUCTURAL (MAE)** theory. It is dedicated to capturing the foundational ideas, early observations, initial hypotheses, and the philosophical underpinnings that first led to the conception of MAE.

As MAE evolved, different conceptual phases will be documented in sequentially numbered subdirectories (e.g., `02_Phase_X`, `03_Phase_Y`, etc.). This initial folder, `01_Initial_Concepts_of_MAE`, specifically focuses on the very genesis of the theoretical framework.

**Contents:**
- `01_early_ideas.md`: A record of the earliest thoughts, inspirations, and rudimentary formulations that formed the bedrock of MAE.
- (Further files will be added here as the initial concepts are elaborated.)
