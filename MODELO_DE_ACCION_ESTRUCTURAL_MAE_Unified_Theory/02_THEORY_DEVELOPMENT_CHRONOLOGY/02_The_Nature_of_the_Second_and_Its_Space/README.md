# 02. The Nature of the Second and Its Space

This directory documents a pivotal phase in the development of the **MODELO DE ACCION ESTRUCTURAL (MAE)** theory, focusing on the fundamental nature of the "second" (defined by the Cesium-133 transition) and the "space" it defines.

It explores the quantitative properties of this space, its internal structure, its limits, and its associated energetic costs. This section includes:

-   **Capture and Quantification of Omega Events:** How individual quantum events (Î©) are observed and their inherent "anomalies" are extracted and symbolized.
-   **Space Quantity and Its Measurement:** Defining and measuring the "quantity" (volume of variability) of a second's space.
-   **The Action Limit Experiment Simulation:** A conceptual simulation demonstrating that structural patterns can be "transmitted" between isolated systems, probing the "Limit of Action."
-   **The Texture of Continuous Time:** Analyzing how the "quantity of space" evolves over time, revealing meta-structures, cycles, and anomalies.
-   **Energy of Purity and Ignition:** Calculating the fundamental thermodynamic costs associated with maintaining a "perfect" second and initiating a quantum action.

This body of work significantly deepens the understanding of time, action, and information within the MAE framework.
