# 01. Capturing and Quantifying Omega Events

This document details the initial conceptual steps for observing and quantifying the individual "Omega (Ω) events" that define a second within the MODELO DE ACCION ESTRUCTURAL (MAE) framework.

The goal is to move beyond simply counting these events and instead extract their inherent "anomalies" – deviations from an ideal, theoretical event – to build a symbolic alphabet of these imperfections.

## 1.1 Capture of a Single Omega Event

The first step involves capturing the waveform of a single Ω event. While a theoretical "perfect" event follows an ideal curve (e.g., a Gaussian), real-world captured events exhibit noise and subtle imperfections. These imperfections are treated not as errors, but as valuable information.

## 1.2 Extraction and Classification of Anomalies

Once an event is captured, the Actuador de Inferencia Estructural (AIE) quantifies its imperfections. This involves:

1.  **Comparison and Residues:** Aligning the captured event with the theoretical ideal and calculating the difference (the "residue").
2.  **Feature Extraction:** From this residue, key interpretable features are extracted, such as:
    *   **Temporal Anomaly (Δt):** How much the peak of the event deviates in time from the expected.
    *   **Amplitude Anomaly (ΔA):** How much the event's intensity deviates from the normal.
    *   **Symmetry/Width Anomaly (Σ):** How the shape or width of the curve deviates.
3.  **Quantization and Symbolization (Clustering):** The AIE then classifies these events into distinct "types" of anomalies using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means). This creates a symbolic alphabet for the deviations. For example, events might be classified as `Ω(Anomalia_Ancho_+)` for a wider-than-normal event, or `Ω(Anomalia_Temporal_-)` for an event that occurred slightly early.

This process transforms the raw event data into a sequence of symbols, allowing the AIE to analyze the inherent "grammar" and patterns within the stream of Ω events.
