# The Structural Action Model: A Complete Framework for Discrete Time, Quantum Action, and Resonant Spacetime

## Abstract
We present the Structural Action Model (SAM), a novel theoretical framework that postulates the fundamental discreteness of time through primordial action quanta. The model's core equation, **C_R = N·h**, where C_R is the relativistic cost, N is the invariant number of discrete actions, and h is Planck's constant, emerges as a dynamic analog to Einstein's mass-energy relation. We demonstrate that time is not a fundamental parameter but an emergent quantum observable with operator **Ĥ** having discrete spectrum σ(Ĥ) = {n·h : n ∈ ℕ}.

## 1. Introduction
The reconciliation of quantum mechanics (QM) and general relativity (GR) remains one of the most profound challenges in theoretical physics. The "problem of time" is a central issue, where time is treated differently in QM (as a background parameter) and GR (as a dynamic variable). SAM resolves this by positing that action, not time, is fundamental. Time emerges from the accumulation of discrete action quanta.

## 2. Axiomatic Foundations
SAM is built upon a set of seven fundamental axioms:
1.  **PUP (Primordial Uniqueness Principle):** There exists a single, unique primordial event.
2.  **Action Quantization:** The action operator Ĥ has discrete eigenvalues.
3.  **Coherence Criterion:** Physical processes must exceed a coherence threshold Κ.
4.  **Structural Threshold:** A minimum of 3 actions are required for a structure.
5.  **Relativistic Invariance:** The number of actions N is a relativistic invariant.
6.  **Thermodynamic Connection:** 1 quantum of action (h) is equivalent to 1 bit of information.
7.  **Resonant Self-Tuning Principle (RSP):** Matter-vacuum interactions minimize energy at resonant frequencies.
