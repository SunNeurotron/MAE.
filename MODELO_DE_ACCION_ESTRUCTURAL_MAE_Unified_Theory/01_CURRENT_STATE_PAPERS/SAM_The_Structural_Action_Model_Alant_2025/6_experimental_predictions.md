## **6. Experimental Predictions and Tests**

### **6.1 Primary Prediction: Frequency-Dependent Deviation**

The master equation predicts:
```
δ(f) = |1 - (f_observed/f_GR)| = 2ξ(L_p/R_c)²/[1-(f/Ω_k)²]
```

Near resonance (f ≈ Ω_k): δ can be amplified to detectable levels (~10⁻¹⁸).

### **6.2 Experimental Protocols**

**Test 1: Frequency Scan**
- Use tunable optical clocks
- Scan frequency range systematically
- Look for resonance peaks in δ(f)

**Test 2: Multi-Clock Comparison**
- Compare Cs (9.2 GHz), Rb (6.8 GHz), Sr (429 THz)
- Each should show different δ values
- Pattern reveals Ω_k spectrum

**Test 3: Gravitational Wave Correlation**
- Monitor δ during LIGO/Virgo events
- Predict: δ oscillates with passing GW
- Amplitude ∝ strain × resonance factor

**Test 4: Biological Efficiency**
- Measure η in neuronal cultures
- Use microcalorimetry + MEA recording
- Predict: η decreases under stress

### **6.3 Immediate Verification**

Map all known stable atomic frequencies → Look for clustering pattern → Compare with theoretical Ω_k spectrum
