## **5. Extension to Complex Systems**

### **5.1 Thermodynamic Bridge**

From Axiom 6 and Landauer's principle:
```
⟨E_dissipated⟩ = (1/η)·(dN_info/dt)·k_B T ln(2)
```

where:
- η ∈ [0,1] is the structural efficiency
- dN_info/dt is the information processing rate

### **5.2 Unified Equation**

The trans-domain unification:
```
C_R/T = N·h/T = ⟨E_dissipated⟩ = (1/η)·(dN_info/dt)·k_B T ln(2)
```

This connects:
- Physics: Action rate of the universe
- Biology: Energy cost of maintaining order
- Consciousness: Energy of coherent thought

### **5.3 Efficiency Parameter η**

- η → 1: Optimal system (flow state, young cell)
- η → 0: Degraded system (stress, aging, disease)

Measurable via:
```
η = (dN_info/dt·k_B T ln(2))/⟨E_dissipated⟩
```
