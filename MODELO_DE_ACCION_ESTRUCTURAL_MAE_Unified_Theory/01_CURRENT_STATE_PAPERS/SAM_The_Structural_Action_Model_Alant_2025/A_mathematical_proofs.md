## **Appendix A: Mathematical Proofs**

### **A.1 Proof of the Unification Theorem**

**Theorem**: From Axioms 1 and 2, C_R = N·h

**Proof**:
1. By Axiom 1, each primordial event carries action h
2. A process p consists of N such events (definition)
3. Total action = Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ h = N·h
4. By definition, C_R ≡ total action
5. Therefore, C_R = N·h □

### **A.2 Proof of Cost Invariance**

**Theorem**: C_R is a relativistic invariant

**Proof**:
1. C_R = N·h (Theorem A.1)
2. N is invariant (Axiom 5)
3. h is a universal constant
4. Therefore, C_R = invariant × constant = invariant □
