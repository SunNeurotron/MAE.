## **4. The Resonant Self-Tuning Principle**

### **4.1 Vacuum Modes and Matter Coupling**

The field φ in a gravitational cavity (e.g., Solar System) satisfies:
```
(□_curved + m²_eff(R))φ = 0
```

Solutions yield discrete modes {ψ_k(x)} with frequencies {Ω_k}.

### **4.2 Energy Landscape**

The effective energy for matter with frequency f:
```
E_eff(f) ≈ E₀ - α_g/(1 - (f/Ω_k)²)²
```

where:
```
α_g ≈ g²|⟨excited|φ|ground⟩|²
```

### **4.3 Dynamic Evolution**

Early universe: Matter-vacuum coupling out of equilibrium
↓
Cosmological relaxation: System minimizes free energy
↓
Present: Stable atomic frequencies "locked" to vacuum modes

### **4.4 Predictions**

1. **All stable atomic transitions correspond to vacuum modes Ω_k**
2. **The spectrum of atomic clocks IS the spectrum of spacetime**
3. **Different gravitational environments have different mode spectra**
