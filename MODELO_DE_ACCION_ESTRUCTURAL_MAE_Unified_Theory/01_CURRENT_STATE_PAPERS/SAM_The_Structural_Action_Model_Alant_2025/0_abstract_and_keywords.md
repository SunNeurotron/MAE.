## **Abstract**

We present the Structural Action Model (SAM), a novel theoretical framework that postulates the fundamental discreteness of time through primordial action quanta. The model's core equation, **C_R = N·h**, where C_R is the relativistic cost, N is the invariant number of discrete actions, and h is Planck's constant, emerges as a dynamic analog to Einstein's mass-energy relation. We demonstrate that time is not a fundamental parameter but an emergent quantum observable with operator **Ĥ** having discrete spectrum σ(Ĥ) = {n·h : n ∈ ℕ}.

The framework introduces the Resonant Self-Tuning Principle (RSP), which predicts that stable atomic transition frequencies dynamically co-evolve with vacuum resonance modes Ω_k, eliminating apparent fine-tuning. This leads to our primary experimental prediction: a frequency-dependent deviation δ(f) from General Relativity in gravitational redshift measurements, amplified near resonances by the factor [1 - (f/Ω_k)²]⁻¹.

We extend the framework to complex systems through a rigorous thermodynamic connection based on the generalized Landauer limit, introducing the structural efficiency parameter η that quantifies how effectively systems convert energy into coherent action. The model predicts testable phenomena including: (1) spectroscopic signatures of spacetime resonances, (2) correlation between gravitational waves and atomic clock variations, (3) measurable efficiency parameters in biological systems, and (4) clustering of stable atomic frequencies around vacuum modes.

The complete framework achieves mathematical consistency (verified through topological analysis yielding Betti numbers β₀=1, β₁=1, β_n=0 for n≥2), compatibility with established physics in appropriate limits, and provides multiple independent experimental tests achievable with current technology.
