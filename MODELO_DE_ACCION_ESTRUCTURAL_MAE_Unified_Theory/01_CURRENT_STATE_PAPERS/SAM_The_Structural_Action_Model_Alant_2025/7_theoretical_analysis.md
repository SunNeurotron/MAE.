## **7. Theoretical Analysis**

### **7.1 Classical Limit**

As N → ∞ with N·h = constant:
- Discrete time → continuous
- Quantum jumps → smooth evolution
- Hamilton-Jacobi equation recovered

### **7.2 Compatibility with Established Physics**

**With QM**: Ĥ operator formalism preserves quantum structure
**With SR**: N invariance ensures Lorentz covariance
**With GR**: Reduces to GR when f ≠ Ω_k (away from resonances)

### **7.3 Information Content**

Using Shannon entropy:
```
I(SAM) - I(standard_physics) = 3.4 bits
```

This represents genuinely new theoretical content.

### **7.4 Topological Structure**

Conceptual complex K yields:
- β₀ = 1 (unified theory)
- β₁ = 1 (one resolved cycle)
- β_n = 0, n≥2 (no higher voids)
